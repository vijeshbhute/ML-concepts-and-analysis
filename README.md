# ML-concepts-and-analysis
My repository for Machine Learning based algorithms and examples. 
Several concepts and analyses are adapted from 'Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-on Python & R in Data Science' on Udemy, online resources from Kaggle and UCI database as well as formal documentations from different libraries.
